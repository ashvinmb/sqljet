= Introduction =

Inventory is a simple warehouse management application. It keeps a list of items with descriptions and their locations (room + shelf). Application runs as a web server so you can connect to it using any web browser:

The link 'Add Item' below the items list allows to add a new item:

Form values are sent to server in query string for simplicity:

Links 'Edit' and 'Remove' allow to edit and delete a particular item:

All requests are logged to console. You may stop the server by typing any text and pressing 'Return'. Here is the log of the above session:

<pre>
Inventory is listening at http://127.0.0.1:8333

Enter any text to shutdown.
