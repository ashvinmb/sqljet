= Introduction =
SQLite defines a pragma statement to query database options and alter its behaviour. Full description is available at http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html page. SQLJet supports a subset of these options via typed and statement APIs.

= Details =
Typed API can be accessed using SqlJetDb.getOptions(). It returns an ISqlJetOptions implementation that has methods to query and alter individual options that correspond to SQLite pragmas.

Method SqlJetDb.pragma(String) allows to execute individual pragma statements and is fully compatible with SQLite syntax. Internally this method delegates to the typed API.

Currently supported pragmas include:
* auto_vacuum
* cache_size
* encoding
* schema_version
* user_version
