= File Format =
SQLJet is fully compatible with native implementation on database file format level. Files created by SQLJet may be read by SQLite and vice versa.

TODO: do we support 'pragma legacy_file_format'?

= File Locks =
Database file lock is obtained for each read and write transaction which corresponds to 'pragma locking_mode=normal'.

TODO: do we support 'pragma locking_mode=exclusive'?

= Concurrency =
SQLJet supports 'multithreaded' mode of SQLite.
